Greetings,

	We decided to take on the land registration issue

	Currently the land registration in remote villages and tribes happen by having representitives of 
	each tribe, which share the borders, and a government official walking around the land and agreeing on
	what land belongs to who. It is mostly done by declaring that this tree or river seperates the land. There are
	many flaws that come with this approach.
	
	We identified three major problems:
		- It is hard to document the exact location of the land
		- As all the documentation is done on paper it takes a lot of time for it to be processed and officially declared
		as the land of the certain tribe. Also, if the documents are lost the land ownership becomes harder to declare.
		- The last but not least having a proper entitlement of the land would allow the villages
		and tribes to put it as an asset when taking loans.
	
	The idea we came up with would eliminate the aforementioned flaws, it would allow the government official walking around 
	with the tribe leaders automatically record the coordinates into the blockchain by using gps devices. 
	
	There would be two devices used in this situation. Authentication device used by the tribe leaders and GPS brought by the 
	government official.
